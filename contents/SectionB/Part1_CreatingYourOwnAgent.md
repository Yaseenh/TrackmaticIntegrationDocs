### __Briefing__

When creating your own integration, make sure you fully understand the requirements of what data needs to be pushed into trackmatic. 

Creating the integration agent process works as follows:
-	Prepare the fields needed as can be seen in Section A – Part 2
-	Select the way in which you want to push data (read from CSV, database etc.)
-	Create baseline code that will read in the fields in the format you provide
-	Add trackmatic’ s libraries and authentication details as in part 3 below
-	Create the model and transform it into trackmatic’ s format as in part 4 below
-	Place agent in secure environment which is stable
-	Test and confirm data been sent to trackmatic 

If there are any issues when trying to create your own integration to trackmatic then feel free to contact any of the trackmatic professional who are part of the handling the project.
