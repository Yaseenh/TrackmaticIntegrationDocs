### __Trackmatic’ s System__

The pre-requisites of this stage are to:
1.	Have a chosen Connection Type (Part 1) 
2.	Populate the Required Fields (Part 2) in a sample file that will be in the format relative to your choice in the above point then provide it to the trackmatic professional developers leading the integration. 
3.	The sample file should be accompanied by its relevant documentation (invoices, delivery notes, trip sheets etc.) for data integrity measures.   

*Note:*
-	This is the longest process of integration and a specific timeline can be acquired from the project manager showing the tasks that is needed to be completed. 

-	Due to ensuring that this integration is done efficiently and effectively whilst bearing in mind that every client is unique in the way they carry out their processes, trackmatic works iteratively to meet the needs and functionalities that we can provide to our client. Therefore, key personnel should be assigned the task of working and communicating with a trackmatic professional to get the best out of our services.  

After having met the pre-requisites, Trackmatic professional developers will create a baseline agent in which users of trackmatic can provide the data to pushed and uploaded into trackmatic’ s API. This baseline agent will be iteratively worked till all functionalities are catered for.  

 Depending on the Connection Type chosen, Trackmatic will provide you with credentials and details for the system you will use (URL, Email, FTP/SFTP) to push data to.


### __External or Client’ s System__

1.	If trackmatic is to integrate into external systems, then Trackmatic will need to be provided with the details for the systems. For example, IP addresses, port numbers, logon credentials and firewall rules etc.
2.	Guidance on where we can obtain the Required Fields (Part 2) will be needed.
3.	Relevant documentation (invoices, delivery notes, trip sheets etc.) in relation to the Required Fields (Part 2) will be need to be provided for data integrity measures.
