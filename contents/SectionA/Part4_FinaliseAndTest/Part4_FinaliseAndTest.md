### __Testing and Training__

Upon completing the task of Creating the Integration Agent (Part 3), automation of providing the file to the system we have provided (URL, Email, FTP/SFTP) will need to be set up from the client’s side.  

Once data is being uploaded regularly, training and testing of data integrity as well as functionalities can commence:
-	Training on how to use trackmatic and all its features can be discussed with the project manager leading the integration. Training can only commence once data is being uploaded into trackmatic’ s API on its appropriate time intervals.
-	During the testing and training phases, any discrepancies, bugs or additional features to be made will be applied and re-tested with the new implementation of these changes. Once again, this task may be iterative to accommodate and fix and unforeseen circumstance that may arise.

Finally, if both the client and trackmatic is pleased with the outcome of the integration, where-by the focus points and business requirements are met, we can then move over into live production. This will be scheduled to occur over a controlled period, preferably when the client is least busy. It is advised to have both the staged and live environment run concurrently until such the live production is stable.
